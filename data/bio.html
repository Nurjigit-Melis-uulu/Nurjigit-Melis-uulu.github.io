                I was born in Karakol on February 23, 2002. I had a very simple and happy childhood.

                As I said, I was born and live in the city of Karakol. I love my city, it's small. You can easily get to the end of the city and return. But in that there is no constant need, the view is all the fuss in the bazaar and in the center of the city. Of the minuses after the collapse of the USSR, there was devastation, and no one was watching. And because of this, my city is dirty, the roads are broken and there are minor flaws. But there is progress, everything is getting better.
